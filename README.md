## Welcome to DeveloperWay's GitHub page! ðŸ”¥

Hello Devs, welcome/willkommen/dobrodoÅ¡li/hoÅŸ geldin/benvenuti to my Github Page! 
I am Omar and I am a Mobile Developer. I am specialized in Android Development in Kotlin and also low-code development with Outsystems.
I like to create applications that can be usefull for people, that is why I decided to start a new journey with the open-source community.
I am starting to work finally on some small own projects and I hope that this could be a new path that gets me near the goals of my life.
